        <h1>Suits</h1>
        
        <p>Even the best lawyer in New York City can use some help.</p>
        
        <p>While running from a drug deal gone bad, Mike Ross (Patrick J. Adams), a brilliant young college-dropout, slips into a job interview with one of New York City's best legal closers, Harvey Specter (Gabriel Macht). Tired of cookie-cutter law school grads, Harvey takes a gamble by hiring Mike on the spot after he recognizes his raw talent and photographic memory. </p>
        
        <p>Mike and Harvey are a winning team. Even though Mike is a genius, he still has a lot to learn about law. And while Harvey may seem like an emotionless, cold-blooded shark, Mike's sympathy and concern for their cases and clients will help remind Harvey why he went into law in the first place. Mike's other allies in the office include the firm's best paralegal Rachel (Meghan Markle) and Harvey's no-nonsense assistant Donna (Sarah Rafferty) to help him serve justice. </p>
        
        <p>Proving to be an irrepressible duo and invaluable to the practice, Mike and Harvey must keep their secret from everyone including managing partner Jessica (Gina Torres) and Harvey's arch nemesis Louis (Rick Hoffman), who seems intent on making Mike's life as difficult as possible.

        <p>Rachel Zane is not your ordinary paralegal. She may not be skilled at taking tests, but she knows Pearson Hardman inside and out. She'll be Mike's guide through the jungle of New York City law. Her research skills are a key asset for Mike as he navigates his way through the tough cases Harvey hands him. It doesn't hurt that she's also beautiful.</p>
